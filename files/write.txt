So 2020 was the year I decided it was time to learn a new programming language. 
I love Javascript — and that will probably never change. But at the same time, 
knowing how to code in more languages is always good for multiple reasons, 
like becoming a more versatile developer, who is able to use a more varied set of tools. 
Because in the end, that’s what a programming language is: a tool that we use to build software.

Golang is a programming language that has been around for a while (since 2009) but it wasn’t just until 
recent years that I began to hear a lot about it. During the past year, in my current job, we had started 
to use it for building some microservices. As a curious person, my interest in this language started 
to grow on me. So I told myself, “All right! It’s time to learn a new language. Here I go!” (pun intended).

In this article, I’ll be describing some of the things I’ve discovered through my learning journey. 
Bear in mind that I’m not an expert with this language. But still, I’ve been able to pick up how it 
works and how to use it quite quickly. I also received some good tips from the Golang Reddit community 
and have more than 9 years of experience in web development. So don’t worry, it’s not like I’m a total 
beginner!
